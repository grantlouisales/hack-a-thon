# hack-a-thon

I've been going through a different tutorial because the last one I was using wasn't updated to xcode 13 and was giving me weird errors. For mine, it utilizes storyboard mode for the user interface then you go through and develop functionality in swift. It makes it really easy to design it while at the same time making things like storing data and new viewcontrollers and button actions fairly easy and straighforward. 

I've got the buttons spaced fairly nicely and a background color set, and I just started working on the second viewcontroller that the buttons will lead to.
