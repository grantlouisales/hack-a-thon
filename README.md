# hack-a-thon 

The purpose of this app is to send you motivated quotes depending on your mood. The layout of the app will have 4 emojis being happy, mad, sad, and neutral. You will select one of these emojis and that will be according to your current mood. Once you press your chosen emoji it will lead you to another screen with a text input. This input will ask why you are in that current mood. It will then figure out your current mood and pull a quote to boost you up from that mood. With this project we would like it to be something that can take in daily mood inputs, get the overall mood of that month and help you figure out ways to improve that mood.
